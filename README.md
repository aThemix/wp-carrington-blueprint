# Carrington Blueprint

This is a WordPress theme boilerplate intended to be your starting point to creating a responsive theme using Carrington Core.

Carrington Blueprint uses several technologies to help you create new themes quickly. It leverages [Crowd Favorite](http://crowdfavorite.com)'s SASSified, 12-column, and responsive [CSSGrid](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/css-grid) and the powerful [Carrington Core](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-carrington-core) CMS theme framework. You can find relevant documentation for Carrington Core in a README located in each directory.
